# Sales Analytics Dashboard â€“ Azure

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using **Azure Synapse Analytics**, **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)**, and **Power BI**.  
It follows the **Medallion architecture** (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) to process and transform raw sales data into curated insights ready for business reporting.

The **Gold layer** is modelled using a **Snowflake Schema** that includes one Fact table and six Dimension tables created through Synapse SQL scripts.  
A connected **Power BI dashboard** visualizes sales, products, and customer performance insights.
